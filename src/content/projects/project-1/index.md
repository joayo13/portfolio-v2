This app was designed to easily get the top-rated place type you're looking for. It returns the highest rated place within what distance you'd like, using a bayesian weighted formula to get top-rated result. (same formula used by imdb to get their top-rated list). It's built with React and uses Googles APIS to create the in-app stylized map and to get the places data.

If you want to, you can download it to your device to have a more native app-like experience as it's a PWA. Feel free to copy the source code and use it however you'd like, I have documented how you can set up for own project in my repo!
